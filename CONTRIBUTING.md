## Branching Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for development
- `feature/xxx`: New features
- `bugfix/xxx`: Bug fixes
- `release/x.y.z`: Release preparation

## Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `develop`
2. Make your changes
3. Submit a pull request to `develop`
4. After review, changes will be merged
